# Stable Diffusion 1.5

I grabbed a bunch of quotes from science fiction authors, and dumped them as prompts into Stable Diffusion 1.5. The results are eery, trippy and somewhat deranged.

## Douglas Adams
*Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.*

## Rudy Rucker

For me, the best thing about Cyberpunk is that it taught me how to enjoy shopping malls, which used to terrify me. Now I just imagine the whole thing is two miles below the moon’s surface, and that half the people’s right-brains have been eaten by roboticized steel rats. And suddenly it’s interesting again.

## Mass Effect
Stand amongst the ashes of a trillion dead souls, and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence is your answer.

## Neal Stephenson
*He turns off the techno-shit in his goggles. All it does is confuse him; he stands there reading statistics about his own death even as it's happening to him. Very post-modern.*

## William Gibson
*Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding...*

*the sky above the port was the color of television tuned to a dead channel*

*I took Punk to be the detonation of some slow-fused projectile buried deep in society's flank a decade earlier, and I took it to be, somehow, a sign.*

## Blade Runner
*I've seen things... seen things you little people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion bright as magnesium... I rode on the back decks of a blinker and watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments... they'll be gone.*

## Thomas Pynchon
*Only the framing material, obvious influences, Neo-Tokyo from Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Metal Gear Solid by Hideo Kojima, or as he's known in my crib, God.*

*The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.*
