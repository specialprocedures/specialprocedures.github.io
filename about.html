<h1>About me</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hi there. My name is Ian, and I�m a researcher based in
Tbilisi, Georgia. I�ve spent most of the last fifteen years working for
international non-profits, largely in the South Caucasus and the Middle East.
You can find my full professional profile and resume on <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igdrch/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<h1>About this site</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>This site exists primarily to document and support my
learning. By writing about what I do, I understand things better, and have more
motivation to complete what I�m working on before moving to the next shiny
thing.</p>
