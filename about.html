<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi there. My name is Ian, and I'm a researcher based in Tbilisi, Georgia. I've spent most of the last fifteen years working for international non-profits, largely in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. You can find my full professional profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igdrch/">LinkedIn</a> and my code at <a href="https://github.com/specialprocedures">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy mucking about with computers, particularly building things and exploring data with Python. My research interests include aid, inequality, media, and drug policy.</p>

<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>This blog exists primarily to document and support my learning. By writing about what I do, I understand things better, and have more motivation to complete what I'm working on before moving to the next shiny thing.</p>

<p>It's built using Jekyll, using the <a href="https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">Clean Blog Jekyll</a> theme by <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/">Start Bootstrap.</a></p>
